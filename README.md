# Amazon Clone Project

Welcome to my Amazon clone project! This project aims to replicate the desktop version of Amazon's user interface using HTML and CSS.

## Overview

This project is a visual replica of Amazon's interface, focusing on demonstrating front-end development skills such as HTML structure and CSS styling. It is optimized for desktop screens and does not currently include full functionality or responsiveness.

## Features

- **HTML and CSS**: Implemented to mimic Amazon's layout and design elements.
- **Desktop Optimization**: The project is currently designed and styled specifically for desktop screens. It is not responsive and may not display optimally on smaller devices such as tablets or smartphones and even some desktop screens.
- **Technologies Used**: Utilizes CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout and positioning of elements.
- **Learning Experience**: Designed as a learning project to explore UI replication techniques and CSS styling principles.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
      $ git clone https://github.com/aadish-25/amazon-clone.git
   ```


2. **Open the project**:
   Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.

3. **Explore**:
   Review the HTML and CSS files to see how Amazon's UI elements are replicated.

## Roadmap

- Implement basic functionality such as navigation, product listings, and interactive elements.
- **Improve Responsiveness**: Update the project to be responsive across various devices to ensure a seamless user experience.
- Iterate on design aesthetics and usability based on feedback and best practices.
